# avatar-generator
In this project, I have created an AI powered avatar generator. Users can input a prompt, an image of their face, and optionally input an image of a specific pose. The app then generates an avatar for them using a Stable Diffusion 1.5 checkpoint along with a ControlNet and ReActor for face swaps. The model itself has been deployed to Runpod with a GPU.
